Instructor Insights
-------------------

{{< quote "One of the ‘big insights’ of rhetoric has always been to know your audience and tailor your message to them. I have found that concrete examples are the best way to make theoretical and abstract ideas more real and understandable for just about any audience, and certainly for students. If I can make the example humorous, as well, then that’s all to the good since humor tends to be more memorable for many of us." "— Steven Strang" >}}
